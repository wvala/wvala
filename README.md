### Welcome to my profile

I'm Will, a 22 year old currently living in the U.K. I have just finished a full-time bootcamp with Le Wagon, and am looking for work as a full stack web developer.

You will find my portfolio projects in "pinned", with Kanaku being the most recent and up-to-date repo.

For other queries, please contact me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wva/">LinkedIn</a>.
