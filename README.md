### Welcome to my profile!

I'm Will, a 22 year old currently living in the U.K. I have just finished a full-time bootcamp with Le Wagon, and am looking for work as a full stack web developer.

You will find my portfolio projects in "pinned", with <a href="http://www.kanaku.me">Kanaku</a> being the most recent and up-to-date repo. To see a more detailed portfolio (for both myself and my projects), please see my <a href="https://www.troopl.com/wva">Troopl</a>.

NOTE: Kanaku is currently only designed for mobile users, whereas Rent-A-Car is better suited for desktops.

For other queries, please contact me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wva/">LinkedIn</a>.
